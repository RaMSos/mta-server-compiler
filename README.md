# MTA Server Compiler

#Basic Information
Name: MTA Server Compiler
Type: Desktop Application
Language: C#




Concept

This application is used to compile Lua (aka "MoonScript") files for an online-gaming community called MultiTheftAuto. MutliTheftAuto introduced their own online Lua compiler, so that the scripts could not be decompiled. The only problem with this is that you could only compile each file one-by-one. There could be hundreds of Lua files on a server, so it could take hours or days to get all the files compiled, and then you would have to go and update the meta.xml files so the server would know what files to load into the game. This was a very long and extensive process. With my MTA Server Compiler, your scripts can be compiled and the meta files updated in just seconds! You simply choose a directy where the scripts are located, then selected the options you want for your scripts (update meta, compile client scripts, compile server scripts, encrypt scripts, anti-decompile) then hit compile, and the application will do everything for you!
